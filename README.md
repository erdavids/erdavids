### Hello, friends ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer while I develop a profusion of side projects.

You can find my work in a few places.

- I'm currently working on [Qyllscape](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1473030/Qyllscape/), my custom, cozy writing software
- I occasionally make [game development tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUrmX3SvpPerq-KAfGBrgGQ) for the Godot engine. I'm hoping to make more [video essays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElwTiEuJoSk) because this one was so much fun to make!

Those are the main things I'm currently trying to focus on, in addition to finishing up my first novel. So much to do!
